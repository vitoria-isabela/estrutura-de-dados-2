# Overview
This repository addresses topics that were seen in Discipline DCC012- Data Structure II of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora - UFJF. This course has been divided into several repositories, which contain exercises on each topic that was covered during the course. Each repository also contains a README file with instructions and explanations on each subject of the discipline.

>If you are just starting to code, it is very necessary that you learn the main Data Structures, as they are common in most programming languages, and you can reuse your programming logic!
